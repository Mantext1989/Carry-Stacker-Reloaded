        v1.6
    </h2>

        <li>
            Fix for not being able to properly play the game online (WHO WOULD WANT TO DO SUCH A THING ANYWAY, AM I RIGHT GUYS?... guys...?)
        </li>
    </ul>

<div>
    <h2>
        v1.5
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>

    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        v1.4
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Rewrote Power-Throw implementation: 
            It's not double-tap anymore, but rather holding the drop-key down.
            As long as you hold down the key, you will drop the bags.
            Upon releasing, you'll stop.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        v1.3
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixed crashes when the host doesn't have the mod, but the client does, and the client tries to pick up bags.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        v1.2
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Properly loading and saving the config now
        </li>
        <li>
            Added ability to sync the settings with clients, if you're the host. They are only temporary (for the current session) and don't overwrite your own.
        </li>
        <li>
            The host can change them mid-game and they get re-synced :)
        </li>
    </ul>
