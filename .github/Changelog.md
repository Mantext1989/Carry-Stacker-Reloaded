## v1.7

BLT 2.0 Compatibility


## v1.6

Fix for not being able to properly play the game online (WHO WOULD WANT TO DO SUCH A THING ANYWAY, AM I RIGHT GUYS?... guys...?)


## v1.5

Fix for duplication. Also, it drops the bags with a proper delay now.


## v1.4

Rewrote Power-Throw implementation: 
1. It's not double-tap anymore, but rather holding the drop-key down.
1. As long as you hold down the key, you will drop the bags.
1. Upon releasing, you'll stop.


## v1.3

Fixed crashes when the host doesn't have the mod, but the client does, and the client tries to pick up bags.


## v1.2

- Properly loading and saving the config now

- Added ability to sync the settings with clients, if you're the host. They are only temporary (for the current session) and don't overwrite your own.

- The host can change them mid-game and they get re-synced :)
