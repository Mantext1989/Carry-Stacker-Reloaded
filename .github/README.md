# Carry-Stacker-Reloaded - update-online-mode branch

This branch is being used to develop the new way in which network messages are exchanged.

The key idea is to allow new versions of the mod to exchange data related to new features,
and preverse backwards compatibility where possible.

Code on this branch might **NOT BE TESTED**. That is why it is on a 
separate branch. It will be merged to master when the new networking protocol is stable.

Use this version of the mod at your own risk.
